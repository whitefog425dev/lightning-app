### Developing Locally

First start by pulling down the git repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-app.git
```

Then go inside the project folder and run npm install (grab a coffee, this might take a while):
```
cd lightning-app
npm install
```

After everything has installed you can run the app in dev mode:
```
npm start
```
